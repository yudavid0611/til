    - CLI(Command Line Interface): interaction between user and computer occurs by commands.
      - Generally, development systems are handled by CLI.
    - GUI(Graphical User Interface): interaction between user and computer occurs through graphical things.

4. **Tips**
   - It is a better way to revise files in the local repository and push it than revise them directly in GitHub.
   - If you want to use your remote repository, make a local directory and connect it to the remote repository. If you have to use another's remote repository, clone it.
   - gitignore: you should make a *.gitignore file* as soon as you make a local repository.
